Hello Guyss! This is Aayush Bharambe, from Pune,Maharashta fresher this year at IIT Patna in CSE dept.
The first week was kind of boring, you know, the expert talks and all other people giving "INFO" and stuff.
But it was important to know the campus at first. 

Also, I have made some amazing friends in the past week, chilling with them and touring the huge campus. I was thankful to the seniors about the commencement
of INFINITO and was super exited for that. As the tournament-fest happened, I saw some close call matches,
like that of cricket, basketball, volleyball, which included both the teams putting up the best fight. It was super fun to watch.
Then came the biggest hit of the fest - 'the ProNight'. It was amazzzinggg!! The best english hits being played
and people just dancing it off... I enjoyed that moment to the fullest. 

So this was how my first week at IIT Patna
went off. I am looking forward to similar fun-filled events in the future .. @SENIORS... Fingers Crossed!!
